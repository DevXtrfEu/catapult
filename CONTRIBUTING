# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Catapult. All forms of contribution are welcome, from issue reports to PRs and documentation / write-ups.


Please do the following before creating PR.
* If you're planning to add or change a major feature in a PR, please ensure the change is aligned with the project roadmap by opening an issue first, especially if you're going to spend a lot of time on it.
* Test cases for your change are present. Generally we don't accept PR's without a test case.
* All tests are passing and build is not failing.
* In development run `mvn install` to properly install all dependencies.
* In development use the packages by simply importing them into your own projects.
